# Workplan for Safe2Choose - AMP Project

The detailed workplan can be found here - https://bit.ly/2Qqgkfu

* I could have done a work plan on the agile board or a Kanban view but due to time limitation, I had to settle for the excel sheet.
* Also, the estimates are assuming I know the team members ability and their capacity to handle project. I have put a very optimistic plan.
* I am assuming that this is a small project hence limiting the team to minimum resources. We could add more developers and reduce the timespan depending on the budget and other constraints.
